# Photo Gallery App

This is a simple photo search app that connects to the Pixabay search API. The app returns the top 40 images and displays them in a gallery. It uses ionic and angular as the tech stack.

## How to Run

1) Install Ionic if needed: `npm install -g @ionic/cli`.
2) Clone this repository.
3) In a terminal, change directory into the repo: `cd photo-search-gallery`, or whatever you name the directory.
4) Make sure you have the latest stable version of node installed.
5) Install all packages: `npm install`.
6) Run on the web: `npm start`.
  
> Note: Please see [ionic setup guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app) for a more in-depth setup process.

> Note: At this time, this app only supports web. A future TODO is to follow the ionic documentation to setup capacitor and the ios and android directories for mobile development.
